            This is for problem tasks that produce multiple fitness values per evaluation; in those scenarios there
            is still a single primary fitness provided by <see cref="P:SharpNeat.Evaluation.FitnessInfo.PrimaryFitness"/>, but there are also one or more
            secondary fitness scores that are for reporting purposes only, i.e., they aren't currently used by the
            evolution algorithm.

            Typically there is a single fitness score whereby a higher score is better, however if there are multiple fitness scores

            If an evaluator has no state then it is sufficient to create a single instance and to use that evaluator concurrently on multiple threads.

             Manhattan distance metric.
            
             The Manhattan distance is simply the sum total of all of the distances in each dimension.
             Also known as the taxicab distance, rectilinear distance, L1 distance or L1 norm.
            
             Use the default constructor for classical Manhattan Distance.
             Optionally the constructor can be provided with a two coefficients and a constant that can be used to modify/distort
             distance measures. These are:
            
             matchDistanceCoeff: When comparing two positions in the same dimension the distance between those two position is
             multiplied by this coefficient.
            
             mismatchDistanceCoeff, mismatchDistanceConstant: When comparing two coordinates where one describes a position in a given
             dimension and the other does not then the second coordinate is assumed to be at position zero in that dimension. However,
             the resulting distance is multiplied by this coefficient and mismatchDistanceConstant is added, therefore allowing matches and
             mismatches to be weighted differently, e.g. more emphasis can be placed on mismatches (and therefore network topology).
             If mismatchDistanceCoeff is zero and mismatchDistanceConstant is non-zero then the distance of mismatches is a fixed value.
            
             The two coefficients and constant allow the following schemes:
            
             1) Classical Manhattan distance.
             2) Topology only distance metric (ignore connections weights).
             3) Equivalent of genome distance in Original NEAT (O-NEAT). This is actually a mix of (1) and (2).

             This digraph mirrors the graph described by <see cref="P:SharpNeat.Neat.Genome.NeatGenome`1.ConnectionGenes"/>; this object represents the

             (i.e. a child that is the result of connection weight mutations only).
             The DirectedGraph class provides an efficient means of working with graphs and is therefore made available
             on this class to provide improved performance for:
              * Decoding to a neural net object.
              * Finding new connections on acyclic graphs, i.e. detecting if a random new connection would form a cycle.
            
             Note. When MetaNeatGenome.IsAcyclic is true then the object stored here will be of the subtype <see cref="T:SharpNeat.Graphs.Acyclic.DirectedGraphAcyclic"/> .

             <remarks>
             The scheme currently in use is taken from SharpNEAT version 2.x, i.e. this is the long standing default scheme
             in sharpneat. There has been little to no exploration of what schemes are good and whether this scheme in particular
             is good, as such this is a candidate for future research and improvements.
            
             At time of writing it was thought wise to adopt the scheme from SharpNEAT 2.x because the code base is being
             rewritten/refactored and it is therefore useful to keep schemes such as this as close to the previous version as
             possible to assist in debugging and testing of the new code base by comparing performance/results, etc. with the 2.x
             code base.

             <remarks>
             This class utilises a depth first graph traversal algorithm to check if a proposed new connection on a given
             graph would form a cycle, as such it is assumed that the graph as given is acyclic, if it isn't then the graph
             traversal stack will grown to infinity, ultimately resulting in an OutOfMemory exception.
            
             The algorithm will perform a full depth first traversal of the graph starting at the proposed new connection's
             target node, and if that connection's source node is encountered then it would form a cycle if it were added
             to the graph.
            
             Each instance of this class allocates a stack and a hashset for use by the traversal algorithm, and these
             are cleared and re-used for each call to IsConnectionCyclic(). This avoids memory re-allocation and garbage
             collection overhead, but the side effect is that IsConnectionCyclic() is not reentrant, i.e. can only be in
             use by one execution thread at a given point in time. A reentrancy check will throw an exception if reentrancy
             is attempted.
            
            
             Implementation Details / Notes
             ----------------------
             This class is optimized for speed and efficiency and as such is tightly coupled with the connection gene list
             data structure, and is perhaps not as easy to read/understand as a traditional depth first graph traversal
             algorithm using function recursion. However this is essentially a depth first graph traversal algorithm that
             utilises its own stack instead of using the call stack.
            
             The traversal stack is a stack of Int32(s), each of which is an index into connList (the list of connections
             that make up the graph, ordered by sourceId and then targetId). Thus, each stack entry points to a connection,
             and represents traversal of that connection's source node and also which of that node's child connections/nodes
             is the current traversal position/path from that node (note. this works because the connections are sorted by
             sourceId first).
            
             As such this algorithm has a far more compact stack frame than the equivalent algorithm implemented as a
             recursive function, and avoids any other method call overhead as a further performance benefit (i.e. overhead
             other than stack frame initialisation).
            
             The main optimizations then are:
            
                * No method call overhead from recursive method calls.
            
                * Each stack frame is a single int32 and thus the stack as a whole is highly compact; this improves CPU cache
                  locality and hit rate, and also keeps the max size of the stack for any given traversal at a minimum.
            
                * The stack and a visitedNodes HashSet are allocated for each class instance and are cleared and re-used for each
                  call to IsConnectionCyclic(), therefore minimizing memory allocation and garbage collection overhead.
            
                * Using a stack on the heap also avoids any potential for a stack overflow on very deep graphs, which could occur
                  if using method call recursion.
            
             Problems with the approach of this class are:
            
                * The code is more complex than the same algorithm written as a recursive function; this makes the code harder
                  to read, understand and maintain, thus increasing the probability of subtle defects.

             A speciation strategy that assigns genomes to species using k-means clustering on the genes of each genome.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This class applies a regularized k-means method as described in this paper:
                "REGULARISED k-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR DIMENSION REDUCTION APPLIED TO SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION",
                Vladimir Nikulin, Geoffrey J. McLachlan, Department of Mathematics, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.
                https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/cibb/nm_cibb09.pdf
            
             The intent of regularization is to discourage formation of large dominating clusters (species), and instead to
             encourage more even distribution of genomes amongst clusters, and also the formation of more stable clusters.
            
             Regularization works as follows. In standard k-means the genomes are allocated to species who's centroid they are
             nearest to, the regularization method in use here adjusts the calculated genome-centroid distances to include an
             additional regularization term, like so:
            
                 adjustedDistance = distance + regularitationTerm
            
             The regularization term (r) is calculated as follows:
            
                 r = (c/populationSize) * L * alpha
            
             Where:
                 c is a cluster size (species size).
                 alpha is a constant scaling factor.
                 L is the maximum distance between any two species centroid.
            
             Thus, the term (c/populationSize) is a proportion ranging over the interval [0,1], where small clusters are
             near to zero and large cluster are nearer 1. As such the regularization term will be higher for larger clusters
             and therefore any genomes on he edges of a large cluster may be allocated to a nearby smaller cluster instead.
            
             L is intended to represent the magnitudes of the distances being dealt with, i.e. it makes the regularization
             method as a whole 'scale free'. The calculation for L used in this class differs from that used in the paper
             referred to above, but the intention is the same, i.e. to obtain some stable value that is representative of
             the magnitude of the distances being dealt with.
            
             In the referred to paper L is taken to be the maximum distance between any genome and any specie centroid. In
             this class we take the maximum distance between any two species centroids, this should result in a scale free
             distance that serves the same purpose, but that is faster to compute. This version of L will tend to be smaller
             that the version used in the paper, but we can adjust alpha (the constant scaling factor) accordingly.
            
             At time of writing this class is experimental and has not been scientifically examined for suitability or
             efficacy in particular in comparison to the standard k-means method.

             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The vectorized code is provided by alternative classes, and these classes tend to be more complex than their
             'baseline' non-vectorized equivalents. Therefore when debugging a problem it is often useful to disable use
             of all vectorized code in order to rule out that code as the source of a problem/bug.
            
             Furthermore, enabling hardware acceleration has been observed to often result in slower execution speed,
             probably because NEAT deals with non-homogeneous, irregular neural network structures that are generally not
             conducive to the application of vectorized code.

             The vectorized code is provided by alternative classes, and these classes tend to be more complex than their

             Furthermore, enabling hardware acceleration has been observed to often result in slower execution speed,
             probably because NEAT deals with non-homogeneous, irregular neural network structures that are generally not

             Input nodes are defined as being at depth 0, the depth of all other nodes is defined as the maximum number
             of hops to each node from an input node. I.e. where multiple paths exist to a node (potentially each with

             The algorithm utilises a depth first traversal of the graph, but using its own traversal stack data

            <remarks>
            The nodes of the graph are arranged into layers, where the layer index (or depth) for a node is defined as the longest path
            (number of node to node hops) to arrive at that node from an input node, thus input nodes are defined as being in layer zero
            (depth 0).

            In acyclic networks the output and hidden nodes are re-ordered by network depth. This array describes
            the index of each output node in the full set of nodes. Note however that the input nodes *are* in
            their original positions, as they are defined as being at depth zero and therefore are not moved by
            the depth based sort.

             An algorithm for checking/testing whether a given graph is cyclic or acyclic, i.e. does a given graph have
             a connectivity cycle.
            
             Method.
             =======
             1) We loop over all nodes in the network and perform a depth-first traversal from each node.
             (Note. the order that the nodes are traversed does not affect the correctness of the method)
            
             2) Each traversal keeps track of its ancestor nodes (the path to the current node) at each step
             in the traversal. Thus if the traversal encounters an ancestor node then a cycle has been detected.
            
             3) A set of visited nodes is maintained. This persists between traversals and allows each traversal
             to avoid traversing into nodes that have already been traversed.
            
             Note. We must traverse from each node rather than just e.g. the input nodes, because the network may
             have connectivity dead ends or even isolated connectivity that therefore would not be traversed into
             by following connectivity from the input nodes only, hence we perform a traversal from each node and
             attempt to maintain algorithmic efficiency by avoiding traversal into nodes that have already been
             traversed into.
            
             The graph traversal algorithm uses function recursion. A number of other classes in SharpNEAT perform
             graph traversal by using a separate traversal stack (stored on the heap); that approach is faster but
             more complex, thus this class has not been converted to the faster approach because it is not directly
             used in the evolutionary algorithm. At time of writing this class is used only in Debug.Assert statements
             and unit tests, thus the simpler implementation is more appropriate.

             <summary>
             An algorithm for calculating the depth of each node in an cyclic graph.
            
             Input nodes are defined as being at depth 0, and the depth of all other nodes is a determined as per the
             following scheme:
            
             Multiple separate traversals of the graph are made, one starting at each input node. Each traversal assigns
             a depth value to the visited nodes, and where a node is on multiple paths, the highest depth value is recorded.
            
             Once all traversal are complete, the average of all depths recorded against each node is calculated and rounded
             up to the nearest integer. Finally, if the scheme has resulted in empty layers (e.g. a node allocated to depth 2,
             but no nodes at depth 1) then the depth values are adjusted to remove the empty layer(s).
            
             The motivation for this slightly convoluted scheme is to create 'balanced' depth allocations when large cyclic
             loops might assign nodes very high depth values that might not be warranted, e.g. if most connections to a node
             would assign it a low depth, but a single cycle assigns it a high depth. Use of a mean/average depth is a
             compromise on the depth allocation of such a node. Median, min, or max could also be used, or indeed any aggregate
             function.
            
             The graph traversal algorithm uses function recursion. A number of other classes in SharpNEAT perform
             graph traversal by using a separate traversal stack (stored on the heap); that approach is faster but
             more complex, thus this class has not been converted to the faster approach because it is not directly
             used in the evolutionary algorithm. At time of writing this class is used only for graph visualization.

             An INodeIdMap implementation based on a dictionary keyed by node ID and a fixed node count.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The fixed nodes count defines the identity mapping (i.e. x maps to x) for IDs from 0 to count-1,
             i.e. it's a cheap way of describing those mappings rather than including them in the dictionary,
             which is relatively expensive to populate and query.
            
             Input nodes are *always* fixed, i.e. they exist in a contiguous run of IDs starting at zero.
             In cyclic networks the output nodes are also fixed, starting directly after the input node IDs.
             In acyclic networks the outputs are not fixed, and are therefore mapped by the dictionary.

             <remarks>
             Overview
             --------
             Represents a directed graph. The graph is described by an array of connections, each with a
             source and target node ID.
            
             The node IDs are actually node indexes, i.e. if there are N unique IDs referred to in the
             connection array then the indexes run from 0 to N-1.
            
             Elsewhere in sharpneat (e.g. in a NeatGenome) graph node IDs are not necessarily contiguous,
             and thus any such graph representation must have its non-contiguous node IDs mapped to zero
             based node indexes to be represented by this class. Such node ID mapping is outside the scope
             of this class.
            
             This class can represent both cyclic or acyclic graphs, however, SharpNEAT uses it in the
             conversion of cyclic NeatGenomes only; a specialized class is used for acyclic graphs that
             gives improved runtime performance for acyclic networks.
            
             Specifics
             ---------
             The connection array is sorted by sourceIdx and secondary sorted by targetIdx. This means that all
             connections from a given node are located in a contiguous segment, the start of which can be efficiently
             located using a binary search. However to improve efficiency further, an array of lookup indexes is
             compiled, which gives the starting index of a connection span/segment for a each source node index.

             Overview
             --------
             Represents a weighted directed graph. The graph is described by an array of connections,
             each with a source and target node ID and a weight.
            
             The node IDs are actually node indexes, i.e. if there are N unique IDs referred to in the
             connection array then the indexes run from 0 to N-1. An exception to this is when representing
             graphs from a NeatGenome in which input and outputs nodes are given fixed IDs regardless of whether
             they are connected to or not, however the use of a contiguous range of node indexes starting at zero
             still holds in that case.
            
             Elsewhere in sharpneat (e.g. in a NeatGenome) graph node IDs are not necessarily contiguous,
             and thus any such graph representation must have its non-contiguous node IDs mapped to zero
             based node indexes to be represented by this class. Such node ID mapping is outside the scope
             of this class.
            
             This class can represent both cyclic or acyclic graphs, however, SharpNEAT uses it in the
             conversion of cyclic NeatGenomes only; a specialized class is used for acyclic graphs that
             gives improved runtime performance for acyclic networks.
            
             Specifics
             ---------
             The connection array is sorted by sourceID and secondary sorted by targetID. This means that all
             connections from a given node are located in a contiguous segment, the start of which can be efficiently
             located using a binary search. However to improve efficiency further an array of lookup indexes is compiled
             which gives the starting index of a connection span/segment for a given source node index.

             A very close approximation of the logistic function that avoids use of exp() and is therefore
             typically much faster to compute, while giving an almost identical sigmoid curve.
            
             This function was obtained from:

             <summary>
             A neural network implementation for acyclic networks.
            
             Activation of acyclic networks can be far more efficient than cyclic networks because we can activate the network by
             propagating a signal 'wave' from the input nodes through each layer to the output nodes, thus each node
             requires activation only once at most, whereas in cyclic networks we must (a) activate each node multiple times and
             (b) have a scheme that defines when to stop activating the network.
            
             Algorithm Overview.
             1) The nodes are assigned a depth number based on how many connection hops they are from an input node. Where multiple
             paths to a node exist the longest path determines the node's depth.
            
             2) Connections are similarly assigned a depth value which is defined as the depth of a connection's source node.
            
             Note. Steps 1 and 2 are actually performed by AcyclicNetworkFactory.
            
             3) Reset all node activation values to zero. This resets any state from a previous activation.
            
             4) Each layer of the network can now be activated in turn to propagate the signals on the input nodes through the network.
             Input nodes do no apply an activation function so we start by activating the connections on the first layer (depth == 0),
             this accumulates node pre-activation signals on all of the target nodes which can be anywhere from depth 1 to the highest
             depth level. Having done this we apply the node activation function for all nodes at the layer 1 because we can now
             guarantee that there will be no more incoming signals to those nodes. Repeat for all remaining layers in turn.

             A neural network class that represents a network with recurrent (cyclic) connections.
            
             Algorithm Overview.
             1) Loop connections.
             Each connection gets its input signal from its source node, multiplies the signal by its weight, and adds
             the result to its target node's pre-activation variable. Connections are ordered by source node index,
             thus all memory reads are sequential, but the memory writes to node pre-activation variables are
             non-sequential.
            
             2) Loop nodes.
             Pass each node's pre-activation signal through the activation function, storing the result in a separate
             post-activation signals array.
            
             3) Completion.
             Copy the post-activation signals into the pre-activations signals array.
            
             The activation loop is run a fixed number of times/cycles to allow signals to gradually propagate through
             the network, one timestep/cycle/loop at a time.
